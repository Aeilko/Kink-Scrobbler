# KinkFM Scrobbler
This extension will scrobble the songs played on the official [Kink FM stream](https://kink.nl/player?stream=stream.kink).
This is a WIP project, so not all functionality is up yet.

## Current status
Currently the extension allows the user to create the required API keys by using the extension options menu.
Once the keys have been generated the extension can set the "Now playing" status on Last FM once the Kink FM stream is started.

## Functionality
This extension will detect when the user is listening to the Kink FM stream, and extract the songs being played.
It will use this information to set the Last FM "Now playing" status, and scrobble the songs once they are done.

## Setup
Once installed the user should link their Last FM account, you can do so by following the instructions on the Extensions "options" page.
