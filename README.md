# Kink Scrobbler
This extension will scrobble the songs played on the official [Kink stream](https://kink.nl/player?stream=stream.kink).
This is a WIP project, so not all functionality is up yet.

## Current status
The extension currently works (once the keys have been generated), however, it does not have error handling of any kind.
So it probably only keeps working as long as nothing unexpected happens

## Functionality
This extension will detect when the user is listening to the Kink stream, and extract the songs being played.
It will use this information to set the Last FM "Now playing" status, and scrobble the songs once they are done.

## Setup
Once installed the user should link their Last FM account, you can do so by following the instructions on the Extensions "options" page.
